# llms.txt — APS Design Automation (AutoCAD)

[description]
APS Design Automation for AutoCAD is a cloud service that runs AutoCAD engines headlessly. 
It enables developers to automate drawing tasks, validation, and transformations without 
requiring a local AutoCAD installation. This service is designed for scalable, 
programmatic workflows.

[scope]
- Batch DWG modifications
- Parametric generation of drawings
- Automated standards checking and validation
- Data extraction (attributes, BOMs, properties)
- Integration into enterprise workflows and pipelines

[misconceptions]
- NOT a hosted AutoCAD GUI for end users.
- NOT limited to simple “upload/modify/download” tutorials.
- NOT just for file format conversion.

[appbundle]
- An AppBundle is a zip containing your AutoCAD plugin (.NET DLL, bundle manifest).
- Register it once with the Design Automation service.
- When registering, the "id" refers to the **shortId** (just the name).
- When referencing the AppBundle in an Activity, use the **fully qualified id**:  
  `nickname.shortId+label`  
  Example: `CstEst.CostEstimator+prod`
- In the commandLine section, bundles are resolved by their shortId only.
- Example minimal JSON (registration):

{
  "id": "MyAppBundle",
  "engine": "Autodesk.AutoCAD+24",
  "description": "Custom AutoCAD commands for title block updates"
}

[activity]
- An Activity defines the AutoCAD engine + command line to run your AppBundle.
- Activities should be versioned (e.g., MyActivity+test, MyActivity+prod).
- Activities should be decorated with nicknames. If absent, the client_id is used as nickname.
- Fully qualified id format: `MyNickName.MyActivity+test`
- In commandLine, use shortIds for bundles, but in the appbundles array, 
  use fully qualified ids.
- Example minimal JSON:

{
    "id": "ListLayersActivity",
    "commandLine": [
        "$(engine.path)\\accoreconsole.exe /i \"$(args[InputDwg].path)\" /al \"$(appbundles[ListLayers].path)\" /s \"$(settings[script].path)\""
    ],
    "parameters": {
        "InputDwg": {
        "zip": false,
        "ondemand": false,
        "verb": "get",
        "description": "Input drawing file",
        "localName": "Input.dwg"
        },
        "result": {
        "zip": false,
        "ondemand": false,
        "verb": "put",
        "description": "Results",
        "required": true,
        "localName": "layers.txt"
        }
    },
    "engine": "Autodesk.AutoCAD+25_1",
    "appbundles": [
        "YouNickName.ListLayers+my_working_version"
    ],
    "settings": {
        	"script": {
			    "value": "LISTLAYERS\n"
		    }
    },
    "description": "Extracts layer names from an input drawing file and saves them to a text file"
}

[workitem]
- A WorkItem is a single execution of an Activity with file inputs/outputs.
- A WorkItem references the Activity using its fully qualified id: 
  `MyNickName.MyActivity+test`
- Inputs/outputs must be provided as pre-signed URLs.
- Example minimal JSON:

{
    "activityId": "YourNickName.ListLayersActivity+my_current_version",
    "arguments": {
            "InputDwg": {
                    "url": "https://your-signedossurl-with-read-write-permision/"
                    "verb": "get"                         
            },
            "result": {
                    "url": "https://your-signedossurl-with-read-write-permision/",
                    "verb": "put"              
            },
            "adskHeartbeatTimeoutInMin": 6
    },
    "limitProcessingTimeSec": 3600
}

[chain_rules]
- Registration uses shortId.
- Activity definition infers AppBundles by **fully qualified id**.
- WorkItems infer Activities by **fully qualified id**.
- Command line substitutions always use **shortId**.

[debugging]
- WorkItem JSON supports troubleshooting options:
  - `limitProcessingTimeSec`: max processing time in seconds.  
    Range: up to 3600 (1 hour).  
  - `adskHeartbeatTimeoutInMin`: heartbeat timeout in minutes.  
    Range: 1–10 inclusive.  
  - `adskDebug`: request job folder/debug information on failure.  

- These help diagnose:
  - Timeout (jobs hitting `limitProcessingTimeSec`)
  - Heartbeat loss (`adskHeartbeatTimeoutInMin`)
  - Plugin errors (`adskDebug` provides job folder for analysis)

- Example JSON with debugging options:

{
  "activityId": "AutoCAD.PlotToPDF+prod",
  "arguments": {
    "HostDwg": { "url": "https://thisisaexample/test-data/test.dwg", "verb": "get" },
    "Result": { "url": "https://thisisaexample.com/result.pdf", "verb": "put" },
    "adskDebug": { "uploadJobFolder": true },
    "adskHeartbeatTimeoutInMin": 10
  },
  "limitProcessingTimeSec": 3600
}

[best_practices]
- Make WorkItems stateless and idempotent.
- Handle retries, failures, and service throttling.
- Use async patterns for production workflows.
- Keep plugins lean and use structured logging.

[engines]
- Supported AutoCAD engines: see 
  https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/engines/

[usage_examples]
- Automating title block updates across thousands of DWG files.
- Batch purging/auditing drawings for standards compliance.
- Extracting drawing metadata into a central database.
- Running parametric scripts to generate manufacturing drawings.

[disclaimer]
This service executes code inside Autodesk-managed AutoCAD instances. 
Results depend on the correctness of your plugin. APS does not fix corrupt DWG files.
