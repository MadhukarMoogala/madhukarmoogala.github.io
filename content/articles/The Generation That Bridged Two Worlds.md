> I’ve blogged before. A different time, a different me. That blog now lies in a quiet corner of the internet — like a diary you forget in a drawer but can’t bring yourself to throw away. If curiosity strikes, you’ll find it [here](https://madhukarmoogala.blogspot.com).

This new space isn’t a reboot — it’s a continuation. Older, perhaps a little wiser, but still curious. Still writing.

### We Were Born Between 1980 and 1990

Born between 1980 and 1990 in India — we’re not a "lost generation," but a quietly weathered one. Not loud, not viral, not on the covers of trend reports — but unmistakably unique in what we saw, survived, and silently adapted to.

We grew up in homes that shared a single landline, watched DD News with our parents, and taped songs off FM radio. We played with spinning tops and paper boats, yet were the first to boot Windows 95. We wrote on slate boards and later typed code on QWERTY keyboards.

We’re the last generation that knows what it feels like to be bored.

### From Floppy to Fiber: Our Tech Timeline

Our introduction to technology was reverent. A floppy disk held 1.44 MB and our hopes. We burned songs onto CDs, learned to eject them gently, and moved to DVDs just in time to witness the rise of LimeWire and pirated encyclopedias.

Then came Napster, Orkut, and Yahoo Messenger — where we tried emojis before they had Unicode. We waited 20 minutes to download a 3 MB song and felt victorious.

The iPod was sci-fi. The iPhone was wizardry. And yet, we remember the crackle of landline wires during a thunderstorm more vividly than any FaceTime call.

### The IIT/MBBS Pipe Dream

As teens, we were shoved into a binary: either crack the IIT/MBBS fortress, or fall into obscurity. You were either a “bright student” or “not serious.” Commerce was fallback. Arts was rebellion.

Kota was Mecca. Coaching centers were temples. Life was an entrance exam and you were either late or behind. Most of us weren’t choosing careers — we were escaping judgment.

What we didn’t know then was: the world was about to flip.

### CS/IT and the Great Migration

The IT boom hit like a monsoon — suddenly, every third person we knew was doing “software.” Didn’t matter if you liked it. CS/IT was the escape hatch from a rigid system into global opportunity.

MS in the USA became the new green card dream. Visa slots were prized more than gold. If not there, a job at TCS, Infosys, or Wipro was enough to “settle down.”

Our 20s were marked by emails from HR, job switches every 18 months, and learning Java in one hand while eating dinner with the other.

### EMI Generation

Somewhere around 25, we were told — “Buy a flat.” The 1 Cr apartment in a dusty suburb became proof that you made it. We started using terms like ROI, square footage, carpet area — while still depending on our parents for choosing ceiling fans.

We married under timelines, not always out of readiness. Some of us followed rituals. Some of us rebelled. Many of us complied.

And life caught up with us. We watched some marriages unravel. For the first time, words like **divorce** and **widow** moved from hushed family gossip to friends in our phonebook. It changed how we listened, and hopefully, how we judged.

We saw *periods* stop being a "secret." It became okay — even **bold** — to say it aloud in classrooms, boardrooms, and even advertisements. We began to appreciate what women go through, even if awkwardly at first. Small victories. Big shifts.

### Why We’re Different

We’re not digital natives — we’re digital adapters. We watched the internet arrive, evolve, and envelop everything. We’re skeptical of every new hype cycle, because we’ve seen enough: Dotcom, Y2K, AI winters, crypto, Web3.

We remember being judged for “chatting on the net.” And now, we lead teams over Slack.

We’ve known solitude without screens. We’ve known joy without sharing it online. And we’ve known struggle without hashtags.

We are the bridge — between analog affection and algorithmic lives.

### And Now?

Now, we’re quietly building. Some of us have kids growing up with tablets. Others are re-learning poetry, art, or peace. Many of us are still working through the idea of *enough* — enough money, enough success, enough approval.

We don’t seek virality. We seek value. We don’t want fame. We want freedom.

And just as we began to feel settled, along comes AI — a new disruption, a new miracle, and a new headache.

We are the souls who once wished AI would just **wash the dishes** or **dry clothes on the line**. Now we’re wondering if it’ll also write our resignation letters, lullabies, or obituaries.

This isn’t nostalgia. It’s memory. It’s tribute. It’s also a quiet nudge to everyone in our age group: *you saw so much, lived through so many transitions — don’t forget to pause and own that story.*

We’re not odd. We’re original.
