My poetry is compass  
when conflicted with decisions,  
deliberations, and delusions —  
a quiet north  
in the storm of second guesses.  

It maps the murmurs  
beneath reason's roar,  
where logic falters  
and feeling finds form.  

In ink I trust —  
to sketch the shape of choice,  
to filter noise  
through cadence and breath.  

Each stanza a signpost,  
each pause a pivot —  
until I find  
myself again  
between the lines
