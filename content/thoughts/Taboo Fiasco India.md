In Taboo Fiasco India, I felt —
By all means, don’t marry,
If you, just carry!
Not love, not dreams,
but the burden they deem
worthy of a woman’s story.

Wear your silence like sindoor,
swallow your no’s,
nurture a home
even when none nurtures you.
And if you rebel —
they’ll hand you guilt
wrapped in rituals.
They said, “Be patient, be pure,
be less, be sure,”
but never
be you.

So I chose poetry
over pity,
solitude
over ceremonies,
a voice
over vows.
By all means —
don’t marry.
If you,
just carry —
not shame,
but the sharpness
of your spine.
