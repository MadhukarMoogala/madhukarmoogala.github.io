From childhood,
I’ve had thoughts that fountain
then drain —
ephemeral,
like whispers on wet glass.
Moments that once lit the soul
now flicker
in the fog of December.

I remember not draft,
I usher to craft —
for memory fails,
but meaning remains.
Maybe today,
I’ll raft through journals,
through time-stained pages
where fragments of me still linger —
half-poems,
unwritten storms,
a sigh tucked between stanzas.

For what I lost
in thought,
I hope to find
in ink.
